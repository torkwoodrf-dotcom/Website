# Hi, I'm Rahmatullah Sadaqat 👋
Web Developer focused on **modern multi-page websites** and **booking/appointment systems** (WordPress + custom builds).  
I build sites that are **fast, mobile-first, SEO-ready**, and easy for clients to manage.

## ✅ What I Build
- **Multi-page business websites** (landing pages, services, pricing, FAQs, contact, blog)
- **Booking systems & scheduling flows** (availability rules, buffers, confirmations, reminders)
- **WordPress development** (custom themes, Gutenberg blocks, plugin integrations)
- **Speed optimization** (image compression, caching, lazy-loading, Core Web Vitals basics)
- **SEO foundations** (semantic HTML, meta tags, schema markup, sitemap, analytics)
- **Forms + automations** (lead forms, email notifications, CRM/Zapier integrations)
- **Deployment & maintenance** (staging → production, backups, SSL, security hardening)

---
